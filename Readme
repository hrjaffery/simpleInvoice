To start this project you have to make sure that you have react-native environment setup in your device. If not, follow this link 'https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup#running-your-react-native-application'.

After the setup, open the project.

Open your terminal and install the dependencies by running either 'yarn' or 'npm install'.

Since we are using flavor, you would need .env files for every flavor. So create them in root directory.

Finally, its time to run the project. You can start the project by running 'yarn android:dev' or 'npm run android android:dev'. This command will run the project in the development phase.

To make an apk, you can either run 'yarn assemble' or 'npm run assemble'. Or go to android folder and run commmand './gradlew assembleRelease'
